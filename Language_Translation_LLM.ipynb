It's worth noting that adults can also appreciate the charm of pandas. The plush is incredibly soft and cute, and my daughter carries it everywhere with her. However, I did notice that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems unintentional. Despite its minor flaw, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected given the price point. I believe there may be larger options available for the same cost. On a positive note, the plush arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy it briefly before passing it on to my daughter. Overall, while there are some minor drawbacks, the quality and cuteness of this panda plush make it a delightful gift option for panda enthusiasts of all ages."
