It's worth noting that adults can also appreciate the charm of pandas. The plush is incredibly soft and cute, becoming my daughter's constant companion. However, I did notice a slight asymmetry in the ears, which I believe was not intentional in the design. Additionally, considering the price paid, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected. There may be larger options available at the same price point. Despite this, the plush arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy its cuddly features before gifting it to my daughter. Overall, while there are minor flaws, the early delivery and undeniable cuteness of the panda make it a worthwhile purchase."
